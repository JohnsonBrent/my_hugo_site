/* Tufte CSS styles */
/* Sidenotes, margin notes, figures, captions */

.sidenote, .marginnote { 
                         float: right;
                         clear: right;
                         margin-right: -60%;
                         margin-left: 0%;
                         width: 50%;
                         margin-top: 0;
                         margin-bottom: 0;
                         font-size: 1.0rem;
                         line-height: 1.3;
                         vertical-align: baseline;
                         position: relative; }

</style>


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
#library(tufte)
# invalidate cache when the tufte version changes
knitr::opts_chunk$set(tidy = FALSE, cache.extra = packageVersion('tufte'))
options(htmltools.dir.version = FALSE)
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, echo=TRUE}
summary(cars)
library(dplyr)
fish <- 99999
```

## Sidenotes

One of the most prominent and distinctive features of this style is the extensive use of sidenotes. There is a wide margin to provide ample room for sidenotes and small figures. Any use of a footnote will automatically be converted to a sidenote. ^[This is a sidenote that was entered using a footnote.] 

If you'd like to place ancillary information in the margin without the sidenote mark (the superscript number), you can use the `margin_note()` function from **tufte** in an inline R expression. `r tufte::margin_note("This is a margin note.  Notice that there is no number preceding the note.")` This function does not process the text with Pandoc, so Markdown syntax will not work here. If you need to write anything in Markdown syntax, please use the `marginfigure` block described previously.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot.new()
par(bg = '#ffffe6')
plot(pressure)
# rect(col = "#ffffe6")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
