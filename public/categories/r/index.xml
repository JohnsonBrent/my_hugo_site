      <description>Here’s a white paper I published on IPR’s web site. It’s somewhat similar to my presentation to the TMAG group at around the same time. But this document here goes into a bit more detail on the model structure.
I’ve been using Stan for most of my Bayesian analysis. And I can’t enough positive things about Richard McElreath’s rethinking package which is a front-end for Stan. McElreath’s book of the same name is outstanding as well.</description>

      <description>On October 18, 2017 I had the pleasure of presenting at the TMAG organization’s 59th semi-annual meeting. TMAG is the Information Technology Market Analysis Group–a collection of market researchers and data scientists from technology companies (e.g., Google, Intel, FaceBook, Microsoft, etc.).
I told a story (with my co-author Jaya Ramaprasad of Microsoft) of how Jaya and I combined a variety of data sources to produce one single estimate of Microsoft’s market share in various server software categories.</description>
