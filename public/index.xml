      <description>IntroductionThe Tufte handout style is a style that Edward Tufte uses in his books and handouts. Tufte’s style is known for its extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and well-set typography. This style has been implemented in LaTeX and HTML/CSS1, respectively. We have ported both implementations into the tufte package. If you want LaTeX/PDF output, you may use the tufte_handout format for handouts, and tufte_book for books.</description>

      <description>Here’s a white paper I published on IPR’s web site. It’s somewhat similar to my presentation to the TMAG group at around the same time. But this document here goes into a bit more detail on the model structure.
I’ve been using Stan for most of my Bayesian analysis. And I can’t enough positive things about Richard McElreath’s rethinking package which is a front-end for Stan. McElreath’s book of the same name is outstanding as well.</description>

      <description>A collection of code projects, most located on my GitHub site. Feel free to comment there or via email.
An R package to generate gamma distribution parameters from judgemental priors. Since the gamma distribution is the conjugate prior for the poisson, this package lets one include judgmental priors on the poisson. For example, I use this when working with a data table (which is poisson-multinomial) and I’ve got multiple data sources or client beliefs about the values in the table or their marginal totals.</description>

      <description>In my day job, I work at International Planning &amp;amp; Research as a project director. I manage teams that solve client market analysis and data science problems. Example engagements include price optimization, share/performance tracking, product portfolio decision-making, prospect identification, customer clustering, text mining, forecasting&amp;ndash;and more. Nothing pleases me more than discovering interesting stories from complex data sets and sharing those stories with clients.
This web site contains some of those stories and discoveries.</description>

      <description>On October 18, 2017 I had the pleasure of presenting at the TMAG organization’s 59th semi-annual meeting. TMAG is the Information Technology Market Analysis Group–a collection of market researchers and data scientists from technology companies (e.g., Google, Intel, FaceBook, Microsoft, etc.).
I told a story (with my co-author Jaya Ramaprasad of Microsoft) of how Jaya and I combined a variety of data sources to produce one single estimate of Microsoft’s market share in various server software categories.</description>
