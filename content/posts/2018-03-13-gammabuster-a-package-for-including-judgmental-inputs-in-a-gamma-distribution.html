<p>I’ve created an R package over on GitHub to generate <a href="https://github.com/JohnsonBrent/gammabuster">gamma distribution parameters from judgemental priors</a>. Since the gamma distribution is the conjugate prior for the poisson, this package lets one include judgmental priors on the poisson. For example, I use this when working with a data table (which is poisson-multinomial) and I’ve got multiple data sources or client beliefs about the values in the table or their marginal totals.</p>

<h2>gammabuster</h2>
<p>The gammabuster package contains two functions that translate judgmental estimates about a random variable into the gamma distribution parameters consistent with that judgement. This is helpful because the parameters of a gamma distribution–its shape and scale–don’t have a real-world interpretation. The lack of a real-world interpretation makes it hard to elicit judgmental estimates about them. However, it’s relatively straightforward to elicit judgments about the likely upper and lower bounds of a distribution or about the mean and range of the distribution. The gammabuster package does just this. It takes judgmental descriptions about a gamma distribution and converts the needed parameter estimates.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>You can install gammabuster from GitHub with:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;)
devtools::install_github(&quot;JohnsonBrent/gammabuster&quot;)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="example" class="section level2">
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Here’s one example. Suppose one has elicited judgments that the range of a random variable lies between 0 and 5. Assuming the random variable is strictly positive and continuous within this space, a gamma might be the appropriate distribution. If so, the following function generates the gamma parameters consistent with the judgement:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>GbusterMinMax(0, 5)</code></pre>
<p>There are more examples and a deeper explanation in the vignette.</p>
