<p>Here’s <a href="/files/Taming%20Noisy%20Data%20Through%20Bayesian%20Analysis%20-%20A%20Market%20Share%20Tracking%20Example.pdf">a white paper</a> I published on IPR’s web site. It’s somewhat similar to my <a href="/posts/2017-10-23-tmag-59/index.html">presentation to the TMAG group</a> at around the same time. But this document here goes into a bit more detail on the model structure.</p>
<p>I’ve been using Stan for most of my Bayesian analysis. And I can’t enough positive things about Richard McElreath’s <a href="http://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/">rethinking package</a> which is a front-end for Stan. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Rethinking-Bayesian-Examples-Chapman/dp/1482253445">McElreath’s book</a> of the same name is outstanding as well.</p>
