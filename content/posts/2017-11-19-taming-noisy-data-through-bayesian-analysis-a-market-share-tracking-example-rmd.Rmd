Here's [a white paper](/files/Taming Noisy Data Through Bayesian Analysis - A Market Share Tracking Example.pdf) I published on IPR's web site. It's somewhat similar to my [presentation to the TMAG group](/posts/2017-10-23-tmag-59/index.html) at around the same time. But this document here goes into a bit more detail on the model structure.   

I've been using Stan for most of my Bayesian analysis. And I can't enough positive things about Richard McElreath's [rethinking package](http://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) which is a front-end for Stan.  [McElreath's book](https://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Rethinking-Bayesian-Examples-Chapman/dp/1482253445) of the same name is outstanding as well.
