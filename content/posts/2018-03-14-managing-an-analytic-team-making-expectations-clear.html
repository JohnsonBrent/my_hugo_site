<div id="a-lack-of-information" class="section level2">
<h2>A lack of information</h2>
<p>It seems like there’s a ton of information out there about this or that research, data analysis, or machine learning technique. Filling one’s company web site or blog with one’s own explanation and demonstration of these tools seems like a common practice in the research world today. If one wants a place in the analytic hierarchy today, it’s important to build one’s quantitative portfolio, to demonstrate one’s experience.</p>
<p>But I very rarely see information about how to manage the overall analytic project, the stakeholders, the team members, or client for project success. There are few explanations or stories on…</p>
<ul>
<li>How to coordinate multiple members of a project team to achieve some desired analytic, research or project result</li>
<li>How to engage with and communicate with clients, how to manage their expectations and maximize their satisfaction</li>
<li>How to schedule project workflow to optimize resources and stay efficient</li>
<li>How to best communicate, lead, and guide project team members to bring out their best effort</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s far more information out there on the latest research techniques and methods; much less on how to <em>lead</em> the team that’s coordinating, organizing, and implementing these techniques and methods, and completing these research projects.</p>
<p>The lack of discussion on how to lead analytic projects can’t be for lack of need. Most analytic projects require a team effort to achieve a desired result. And success doesn’t rest on one single individual or research technique. In fact, in my experience the key factor in project success is rarely dependent on the choice or implementation of one particular research method. So, why the collective ignorance on the more important part of analytic work? Why the lack of commentary within the blogosphere? And I’ve yet to see any course curricula that address such stuff.</p>

<div id="the-analytic-personality" class="section level2">
<h2>The analytic personality</h2>
<p>It appears to me that that good researchers and analysts tend toward a particular personality type. Of course that’s not true in all cases. There’s always some variance. But this variance is around some mean, its scattered about a central tendency. And the best researchers are often on the right-hand side of the bell curve when it comes to these tendencies. Specifically, successful analytic people are often strong in…</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/extraversion-or-introversion.htm">Introversion over Extroversion</a>. Really good researchers are often more focused on their own internal thoughts and aren’t preoccupied trying to decipher the internal thoughts or processes of others–those on their own team, their stakeholders, (and even sometimes their clients). Good researches can often “tunnel in” on a task or problem and ignore the world around them until they solve the problem. And they certainly don’t like interruptions when they’re in this head-space.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/sensing-or-intuition.htm">Intuition over Sensing</a>. As opposed to focusing on just the immediate reality in front of them or what’s being presented to their senses, good researchers often quickly try to intuit the patterns and meaning behind what they see. Instead of being focused directly on the their senses and the “now,” they’re quick to think about what’s next or what’s implied and might be possible as a result of what they observe.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/thinking-or-feeling.htm">Thinking more than Feeling</a>. When you’re making a decision, do you try to focus on the facts and the pros and cons of different alternatives? if so you’re more thinking-oriented. Or when you make a decision do you concerns creep in about the consequences of the decision on those around you, or on your own appearances and how you’ll be perceived? The later behavior is more feeling-oriented. No one is all or nothing here, but Thinkers are relatively more concerned with the former–the immediate facts, the pros and cons.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/judging-or-perceiving.htm">Judging over Perceiving</a>. Those strong in Perceiving put an emphasis on flexibility and looseness. They prefer to maintain an element of spontaneity in their plans. Perceivers don’t like being too tied to one particular course of action for fear they’ll miss-out on responding to new, important information. Judgers, by contrast, often feel more comfortable when the world around them is settled and organized. These people like to make lists. They’re task-oriented. In contrast, to Perceivers, Judgers sometimes fear that new, unhelpful information could lead them away them from their main focus and mission.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now again, no one person resides at the polar extreme on all four of these dimensions. The poles above are caricatures. In reality, we all possess some of each of these eight qualities. But those relatively strong in these four areas–Introversion (I), Intuition (N), Thinking (T), and Judging (J)–are what advocates of the <a href="http://www.myersbriggs.org/">Myers-Briggs</a> typology call <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality">the INTJ personality</a>. And such personality types are often naturally geared for completing innovative, analytic and research work. They’re good at it.</p>

<p>In fact, you probably readily recognize this personality type–perhaps in yourself (since you’re reading this article)–or possibly in others including your co-workers. Or consider this: can you relate to or do you admire any of the following individuals?</p>
<ul>
<li>John F Kennedy (president)</li>
<li>Dwight D Eisenhower (president, general)</li>
<li>Thomas Jefferson (founding father, president)</li>
<li>Elon Musk (business)</li>
<li>Mark Zuckerberg (business)</li>
<li>Charles Darwin (scientist)</li>
<li>Nikola Tesla (scientist)</li>
<li>Stephen Hawking (scientist)</li>
<li>Ann Rand (author)</li>
<li>Issac Asimov (author)</li>
<li>Sun Tzu (author)</li>
<li>Sherlock Holmes (fictional detective)</li>
<li>Bruce Wayne (Hey, who doesn’t like Batman?)</li>
<li>Roger Waters (musician)</li>
<li>Jay-Z (musician)</li>
<li>Nick Saban (sports)</li>
<li>Lance Armstrong (sports. You gotta admit that his extreme pursuit sort of fits the profile)</li>
</ul>
<p>Yep. They’re all INTJs according to <a href="https://www.personalityclub.com/blog/famous-intj/">one assessment</a>. And they’re all successful (or infamously so).</p>
<p>Just a little side story: I once took a job at a company that required all employees to complete a personality assessment as part of the hiring process. I don’t think the test I took was exactly the Myers-Briggs instrument. The company used some other questionnaire. But it was very similar. Evidently I passed the test because I got the job. Then after about the first two weeks of work, I was struck by how much in common I had with my co-workers. “Wow,” I thought. “I don’t think I’ve ever worked at a place where everyone seemed to get along so well.” After all, there wasn’t any drama. We seemed focused on the work. We seemed to even read others’ minds at times. Together we functioned like a well oiled machine. I finally remarked about all this to one of my co-workers. I explained to him how surprised I was by how much in common we all had. He looked at me and laughed. “Sure,” he said. “Of course we all get along. We all scored the same on that dumb personality test and the company doesn’t hire anyone otherwise.” I chuckled. I think we all scored somewhere on the positive sides of the INTJ spectrum. …And we did great work together. Is my felt experience and our success just a sample of one? I don’t think so. There’s a personality pattern at work here.</p>

<h2>Good management skills don’t come naturally</h2>
<p>But here’s the thing when it comes to leading analytic project teams:</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">
The best analysts or researchers are often promoted to managing others on the assumption that, “If she or he can do the work so well, no doubt she or he can lead a team of more people to do more work even better.”
</h1>
<p>But sadly, this is also completely untrue. What it takes to be a good analyst or researcher is completely orthogonal to what it takes to be a good manager of analysts, researchers, scientists, and projects. Yes, good researchers can grow into becoming good managers. But it’s not an automatic process. Being a good project team leader requires a departure from the strict INTJ mind set.</p>
<center>
<img src="/img/INTJ_I_hate_talking_to_people.png" alt="INTJwordle" style="width:50.0%" />
</center>
<p>Ironically, team and project leaders strong in INTJ traits actually need to grow their non-INTJ skills in order to better lead their analysts, researchers, and scientists. Expressed back in the words of the Myers-Briggs typology, good-analysts-turned-managers need to allow for more spontaneity (or “<a href="http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/judging-or-perceiving.htm">Perceiving</a>”) as they help their teams, e.g., they need to give their team members a wide berth within which the team can discover creative solutions for getting the work done. Good leaders of researchers need to break-out of their introspection and attempt more “<a href="http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/extraversion-or-introversion.htm">Extroversion</a>” in the form of focusing on the thoughts and motives of others. And they need to make decisions <em>precisely</em> with an eye towards the consequences and how it will affect the work and lives of those around them (the “<a href="http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/thinking-or-feeling.htm">Feeling</a>” element in Myers-Briggs). And it also helps to add dose of the “<a href="http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/sensing-or-intuition.htm">Sensing</a>” component. That is, leaders of analytic teams need to restrain themselves from directly imposing their prior beliefs or patterns on what they observe as their team goes about meeting a particular overall objective. Instead, engage in an inquiry that allows the team their own discovery process. Team leaders also need to recall that others can’t read their own (brilliant) minds. Project expectations need to be shared–and then shared again. And one more thing… those project expectations need to be shared yet again!</p>
<p>Granted, every project is different and one needs to calibrate the above according to the level of project urgency. The more urgent the project, the more Judging, Thinking, and Intuition that’s often required. …But if every project is somehow the new more urgent one, well, there’s probably something else that’s wrong.</p>
<p>Group leaders who tackle their research project teams with the same skills that they themselves would use to tackle elements of the project itself, may get the analytic project done. But such managers tend to leave dead, burned-out researchers in their wake. It’s not a durable strategy.</p>

<div id="the-consequences-for-project-and-team-leadership" class="section level2">
<h2>The consequences for project and team leadership</h2>
<p>So, what about the question with which I started this post? Why is there so much more information and discussion available on <em>implimenting</em> particular analytic and research methods than there is on <em>managing</em> the researchers, the analytic team members, and the overall project?</p>
<p>Here are a few reasons.</p>
<p>First of all it’s much easier to do analytic work than it is to do people work–at least for this personality type. That is, it’s relatively simple to understand and master an analytic tool, a piece of software, or an algorithm–and produce a result the pleases one’s boss or a client all on one’s own. It’s much harder (and it takes more time) to draw observations about the group dynamics of a larger project team and master the best way to lead them in a tightly synchronize effort towards a successful outcome. There are a lot more variables involved in the later; a lot more potential disruptions.</p>
<p>It’s also more fun to do the analytic work. I’ve not read this anywhere, but for the INTJ personality it’s almost as if there’s a dopamine or endorphin rush that comes with the research pursuit, the discovery process. It’s very mentally rewarding work to do. Warning: you may recognize yourself in this, but those bent towards the INTJ side of the spectrum can work all afternoon burrowed deeply on a project and then will actually feel annoyed if they need to break-away at 5pm. For this same personality type, there’s just not the same sort of rush that comes from sharing or talking about the people or social side of their experience.</p>
<p>Finally, and closely related to the items above, there’s a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias">survivorship bias</a> at work here. Again, many of those promoted into managerial roles got there because of their analytic skill set. But the two skills–solving research problems vs. solving the problems of those tasked with solving research problems–are very different. So, those most likely to be in a role where they might otherwise share, blog, or opine about managerial skills, are actually the ones who are simultaneously the least likely to posses those skills–at least not naturally–let alone ruminate on those skills or share them socially. Meanwhile, those more on the other end of this Myers-Briggs continuum, are either less likely to get called-out as successful analysts and promoted (as they’ve earned less organizational cred). Or they were never attracted by analytic work and were self-selected out of the field in the first place.</p>
<p>But there’s hope. These project and group leadership skills can be learned. And managing teams is very mentally rewarding–albeit in a different sort of way.</p>
