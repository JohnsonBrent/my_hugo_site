<p>A collection of code projects, most located on my GitHub site. Feel free to comment there or <a href="brent@centralmoment.com">via email</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>An R package to generate <a href="https://github.com/JohnsonBrent/gammabuster">gamma distribution parameters from judgemental priors</a>. This is helpful if one wants to fit a Bayesian model with a poisson likelihood. Since the gamma distribution is the conjugate prior for the poisson, this package lets one include judgmental priors on the poisson. For example, I use this when working with a data table (which is poisson-multinomial) and Iâ€™ve got multiple data sources or client beliefs about the values in the table or their marginal totals.</li>
