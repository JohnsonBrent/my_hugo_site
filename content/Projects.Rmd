A collection of code projects, most located on my GitHub site.  Feel free to comment there or [via email](brent@centralmoment.com).

* An R package to generate [gamma distribution parameters from judgemental priors](https://github.com/JohnsonBrent/gammabuster). Since the gamma distribution is the conjugate prior for the poisson, this package lets one include judgmental priors on the poisson. For example, I use this when working with a data table (which is poisson-multinomial) and I've got multiple data sources or client beliefs about the values in the table or their marginal totals.
